# Technical Report: Frontend Assessment Optimizations

This report details the technical improvements made to the frontend assessment codebase, focusing on performance, modularity, and maintainability.

## 1. Heavy CPU Computation Offloading with Web Workers

To prevent the main thread from becoming blocked during CPU-intensive operations, I've implemented a web worker to handle heavy computations. This ensures a smooth and responsive user interface, even when processing large amounts of data.


## 2. Virtualizing Large Datasets with React Window

To efficiently render large lists of transactions without sacrificing performance, I've integrated `react-window`. This library renders only the items currently visible to the user, significantly reducing the number of DOM elements and improving rendering speed.

### Implementation

-   **`src/components/TransactionList.tsx`**: The `TransactionList` component now uses `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList` to display transactions. This allows us to render thousands of transactions with minimal performance impact.


## 3. Modularized Components and Separation of Concerns

The application's components have been refactored to promote modularity and a clear separation of concerns. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and test.

### Implementation

-   **`src/components/dashboard/`**: The `Dashboard` component is now composed of smaller, more focused components like `DashboardControls`, `DashboardStats`, and `TransactionDetailsModal`. Each component is responsible for a specific piece of the UI, making them more reusable and easier to manage.

-   **Custom Hooks**: I've extracted the business logic from our components into custom hooks. This separates the UI from the underlying logic, improving reusability and testability. For example:
    -   `useTransactions`: Manages the state and fetching of transactions.
    -   `useTransactionData`: Provides the raw transaction data.
    -   `useTransactionAnalytics`: Handles the calculation of transaction analytics.



## 4. Memory Leak Prevention and Unnecessary Re-renders

To ensure optimal performance and resource utilization, several measures have been implemented to prevent memory leaks and minimize unnecessary component re-renders.

### Implementation

-   **`useCallback` and `useMemo` Hooks**: These React hooks are strategically used to memoize functions and values, preventing their re-creation on every render. This is particularly effective for props passed to child components, ensuring that child components only re-render when their actual props change.
-   **`useEffect` Cleanup Functions**: `useEffect` hooks are used with cleanup functions to properly dispose of subscriptions, timers, and other resources when a component unmounts. This prevents memory leaks by ensuring that no references to unmounted components persist.
-   **Conditional Rendering and Early Exits**: Components are designed to render conditionally or exit early if their props or state have not changed, avoiding redundant rendering cycles.

## 5. useDebouncer Hook for debouncing any function
A custom `useDebouncer` hook has been created to debounce any function, allowing us to control the frequency of function calls, especially for user input events like search or filter operations.

### Sample usage
```typescript
import { useDebouncer } from "../hooks/useDebouncer";

const undebouncedFunction = (value: string) => {
    console.log(value);
};

const debouncedFunction = useDebouncer(undebouncedFunction, 300);

```



### Benefits
-   **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Proper cleanup of resources prevents memory accumulation over time.
-   **Improved Performance**: Minimizing unnecessary re-renders leads to a smoother and more responsive user experience, especially in complex applications with many components.
-   **Improved Readability**: Smaller, more focused components are easier to read and understand.
-   **Enhanced Reusability**: Components and hooks can be easily reused throughout the application.
-   **Simplified Testing**: Separating logic from the UI makes it easier to write unit tests for our business logic.

## Performance Improvements

-   **Reduced Memory Consumption**: Memory usage has dropped to around 130 MB from over 1 GB.
-   **No Main Thread Blocking**: The main thread is no longer blocked, eliminating UI freezes during heavy computations.
-   **Smoother User Experience**: Scrolling through the transaction list is now seamless and stutter-free.
