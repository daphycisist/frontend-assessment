# 🚀 FinTech Dashboard Performance Optimization Assessment

## Overview

You're joining a fintech startup as a Senior Frontend Developer. The current transaction dashboard has critical performance issues affecting user experience. Your task is to identify and fix these issues to optimize the system for production use.

## 📋 Assessment Instructions

### Time Allocation

- **Total Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Level 1**: 30 minutes (Analysis & Documentation)
- **Level 2**: 2-2.5 hours (Core Optimizations)
- **Level 3**: 1-1.5 hours (Advanced Features)

### Submission Requirements

1. **Optimized Code** with your fixes
2. **Brief Performance Report** (1-2 pages) documenting key improvements
3. **5-minute Demo** showing before/after performance

## 🎯 Level 1: Performance Analysis (25%)

### Task: Identify and Document Performance Issues

**Deliverables:**

- List of identified performance issues with brief explanations
- Performance measurements (before optimization)
- Priority ranking of issues to fix

**Expected Issues to Find:**

- Memory leaks (intervals, event listeners, growing arrays)
- CPU-blocking operations (heavy loops, synchronous processing)
- Inefficient rendering (no virtualization, unnecessary re-renders)
- Poor data structures (linear search, no indexing)
- Missing memoization

## ⚡ Level 2: Core Performance Optimizations (50%)

### Task: Implement Essential Performance Fixes

**Required Optimizations:**

#### 2.1 Virtual Scrolling

- Replace inefficient list rendering with virtualization
- Handle large datasets smoothly

#### 2.2 Search Optimization

- Implement efficient search with debouncing
- Add basic result caching

#### 2.3 Memory Management

- Fix memory leaks in intervals and event listeners
- Implement cleanup strategies

#### 2.4 Re-render Optimization

- Add proper memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## 🚀 Level 3: Advanced Features (25%)

### Task: Production-Ready Optimizations

Choose **2 out of 3** of the following:

#### 3.1 Web Workers Integration

- Move heavy calculations to background threads
- Implement data processing workers

#### 3.2 Intelligent Data Loading

- Implement pagination or lazy loading
- Add data prefetching strategies

#### 3.3 Performance Monitoring

- Add performance metrics collection
- Create performance budgets

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Minimum Acceptable

- **Initial Load**: <3 seconds for 100K records
- **Search**: <200ms response time
- **Scrolling**: Smooth 60fps
- **Memory**: <200MB total usage

### Excellence Targets

- **Initial Load**: <1 second
- **Search**: <100ms response time
- **Scrolling**: Consistent 60fps
- **Memory**: <100MB total usage

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Implementation (40%)**: Do the solutions work effectively?
- **Performance Impact (35%)**: Measurable improvements in key metrics
- **Code Quality (25%)**: Clean, maintainable code with proper practices

## 🚨 Common Performance Issues to Look For

The dashboard has several performance bottlenecks that you should identify and fix:

### Memory Management

- Interval cleanup and event listener management
- Growing data structures without limits
- Memory leaks from uncleaned references

### CPU Usage

- Heavy synchronous operations
- Expensive calculations in render loops
- Missing debouncing/throttling

### Rendering Performance

- Large dataset rendering without virtualization
- Missing React optimization patterns
- Unnecessary component re-renders

### Data Processing

- Inefficient search and filtering algorithms
- Missing indexing or caching strategies
- Multiple passes through large datasets

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**: `yarn install`
2. **Start development server**: `yarn dev`
3. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
4. **Begin analysis**: Use browser dev tools to identify performance issues
5. **Document findings**: Create your performance audit
6. **Implement optimizations**: Work through levels 1-3
7. **Submit deliverables**: Code, report, and demo

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Start with analysis**: Use React DevTools and browser performance tools
- **Measure everything**: Record metrics before and after each optimization
- **Focus on impact**: Prioritize fixes that provide the biggest performance gains
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
- **Document your approach**: Explain your reasoning for each optimization
