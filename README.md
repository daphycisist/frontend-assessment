# 🚀 FinTech Dashboard - Senior Frontend Assessment

## Overview

Transform this fintech transaction dashboard into a production-ready application. The current system has performance bottlenecks, architectural issues, and UX problems that need senior-level solutions.

**Time: 4-6 hours**

## 📋 Your Mission

### Performance Optimization (50%)

- **Analyze**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- **Fix**: Memory leaks, CPU blocking, inefficient rendering, poor algorithms
- **Measure**: Document before/after performance improvements

### Architecture & Code Quality (30%)

- **Refactor**: Break down monolithic components
- **Optimize**: State management and data flow
- **Clean**: Apply SOLID principles and consistent patterns

### UI/UX Enhancement (20%)

- **Choose 2**: Responsive design, advanced interactions, accessibility, or progressive enhancement
- **Improve**: User experience with thoughtful design decisions

## 🎯 Performance Targets

- **Load**: <1 second for 100K records
- **Search**: <100ms response time
- **Memory**: <100MB usage
- **Scrolling**: Smooth 60fps

## 🚨 Known Issues to Address

- Memory leaks from intervals and growing arrays
- CPU-blocking operations in render loops
- Missing virtualization for large datasets
- Inefficient search without debouncing
- Unnecessary re-renders and missing memoization
- Monolithic components with mixed concerns
- Complex state structures and context recreation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`
3. Analyze performance with dev tools
4. Implement optimizations
5. Submit: code + technical report + demo

## 📊 Deliverables

1. **Optimized codebase** with architectural improvements
2. **Technical report** covering optimizations, architecture decisions, and UX enhancements

_Note: Be prepared to discuss your technical decisions and demonstrate improvements during the follow-up call._

## 💡 Success Criteria

- Measurable performance improvements
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Production-ready code quality
- Thoughtful user experience enhancements

## 🎯 What Good Looks Like

### **Excellent Architecture**

- **Components**: Single responsibility, reusable, composable
- **State**: Minimal, normalized, co-located with usage
- **Patterns**: Consistent naming, clear abstractions, proper error boundaries
- **Separation**: Business logic separate from presentation logic

### **Performance Excellence**

- **Measurement**: Before/after metrics with profiling screenshots
- **Optimization**: Targeted fixes addressing root causes, not symptoms
- **Scalability**: Solutions that work for 100K+ records
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory efficiency

### **Professional Quality**

- **Code**: Clean, self-documenting, follows established patterns
- **Documentation**: Clear rationale for architectural decisions
- **Testing**: Considerations for maintainability and edge cases

## 📏 Evaluation Rubric
